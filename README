spooldo: spool directory processing utility
-------------------------------------------

spooldo is a script for continuously processing the files that accumulate in
a directory.

It takes three parameters on the command line: the "incoming" directory, the
"active" directory, and the "archive" directory. The incoming and active
directories are required; the archive directory is optional. spooldo
continuously links new files in the incoming directory into the active
directory, and then unlinks them from the incoming directory.

If an archive directory is specified, new files will also be linked (or, if
the archive directory is on another filesystem, copied) into it.

If the SPOOLDO_COMMAND_TEMPLATE environment variable is set, this value will
be used to construct a command that will be executed for each file as it
passes through the "active" directory. The sequence "%fname" in the command
template will be converted to the path to the file to be processed.

If the SPOOLDO_JOBS environment variable is set to a positive integer,
spooldo will run up to the given number of commands concurrently.

If the SPOOLDO_ORDERED environment variable is set, files in the incoming
directory will be processed in sorted order.
